## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a 28-year-old programmer based in Denmark, currently working as an apprentice while completing my programming education (graduating in 2028).

I work on a wide range of real-world projects — both professionally and academically — gaining hands-on experience with modern development practices, clean code, and scalable solutions.

I enjoy solving problems, building useful systems, and continuously improving my technical skills.
